            <h2>FAQs: Commercial Gym Equipment List</h2>
            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>What is the essential equipment list for a commercial gym?</h3>
                <p>A complete commercial gym needs: 6–10 cardio machines (treadmills, bikes, rowers), 8–12 strength stations (selectorized, plate-loaded, racks), functional accessories (kettlebells, bands, bars), and support items (flooring, storage, mirrors). Start with Ntaifitness’s <a href="essential-commercial-gym-equipment.html">Top Essential List</a> for core ROI machines.</p>
                
                <h3>How many pieces of equipment do I need for a small gym?</h3>
                <p>A 1,000–1,500 sq ft gym can operate profitably with 15–20 key pieces: 3 treadmills, 1 rower, 1 bike, 1 leg press, 1 chest press, 1 multi-stack tower, 1 power rack, and essential free weights. Ntaifitness’s <a href="small-commercial-gym-equipment.html">small gym bundles</a> optimize this setup.</p>
                
                <h3>What’s the difference between commercial and home gym equipment?</h3>
                <p>Commercial equipment uses thicker steel (3mm+ vs 2mm), industrial bearings, higher weight capacities (300–1,200 lbs vs 200–300 lbs), and is tested for 12+ hours/day use. It also includes enhanced safety systems and longer warranties (7–10 years vs 1–3 years).</p>
                
                <h3>Can I buy used commercial gym equipment from Ntaifitness?</h3>
